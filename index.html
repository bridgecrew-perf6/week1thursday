            <p class="card-text">The Intercounty Connector can be traced to plans developed in the 1950s for the proposed 122-mile (196 km) Washington Outer Beltway.
                    The original Outer Beltway had been planned to pass south of the corporate limits of the City of Rockville. The original proposed routing was south 
                    and east of the current alignment.The new route was motivated in part by a desire to move the routing of the proposed bridge over the Potomac River 
                    upstream from the area of River Bend to Watkins Island. Virginia residents and the United States Department of the Interior objected to the proposed
                     bridge over the Potomac River because they wanted to create state and federal parks along the river in order to protect sugar maple trees, vegetation,
                    and bald eagles. Because of these concerns, the Maryland State Roads Commission moved the proposed Outer Beltway to a route north of Rockville and 
                    eliminated a new bridge crossing the Potomac River.</p>

            <p class="card-text">In 1980, the state of Maryland dropped the Washington Outer Beltway from its plans except for the Intercounty Connector. Meanwhile, the State Highway 
                    Administration was studying constructing a 22-mile (35 km) Intercounty Connector with a 10-mile (16 km) spur called the Rockville Facility.After six days of public
                     workshops, the Maryland State Highway Administration released its first report about the Intercounty Connector and the Rockville Facility in January 1980. Because of these concerns, the Maryland State
                      Roads Commission moved the proposed Outer Beltway to a route north of Rockville and eliminated a new bridge crossing the Potomac River The Montgomery County Planning Board accepted the state's newly 
                      proposed route in 1970, but the Montgomery County Council rejected it, and Prince George's County and Virginia dropped it from their plans.[15] In 1975, the National Capital Region Transportation Planning 
                      Board of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments endorsed a request from the State Highway Administration "for federal support of a $1.1 million planning and engineering study of the first 8-mile 
                      [13 km] segment of the road"</p>

            <p class="card-text">In 1999, staff to the Montgomery County Planning Board said that the Intercounty Connector could be removed from master plans, but that such an effort would take "six or seven years" to accomplish.[42] In November 1999, the Montgomery County Council discussed removing the Intercounty Connector from master plans, 
                and while five of the nine members were opposed to the Intercounty Connector, the District 4 member, Marilyn Praisner, declined to agree to removal of the master-planned route, for fear that the so-called Northern Alignment (Corridor 2 in the 2005 Draft Environmental Impact Statement) would become a de facto Intercounty Connector in the future.
                 The effort by Montgomery County politicians to remove the Intercounty Connector from its plans irritated powerful members of the Maryland General Assembly (notably Senate President Thomas V. "Mike" Miller), who discussed legislative measures that could be taken in the General Assembly to thwart such a move.[44][45] In February 2000, an agreement 
                 between Montgomery County's politicians and members of the General Assembly reached an agreement "memorialized in two letters but not cast in stone" that the "... Council agreed not to take any action to kill the ICC during the next three years."</p>
